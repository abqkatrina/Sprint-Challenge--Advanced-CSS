What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
  An adaptive site has breakpoints where the content changes based on ranges of size.  A responsive site changes based on size, no matter how big or small the viewport is.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
  The site is built to display on small screens with larger screens requiring modifications instead.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
  It changes the font to 10px, from which we can use decimal rems as an easier measurement.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
  You write the easier code and the computer turns it into CSS for you. It's magic.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
  I like nesting the best because it makes things better organized. I had trouble with getting my mixins to work but I think I was using the wrong syntax.
